    <string name="bract_mosaic_desc">Banana brat mosaic disease (BBrMD) is caused by the Banana brat mosaic virus (BBrMV). The disease is widespread not only in banana-growing regions but also in  abaca-growing areas and is considered the most widely occurring disease in abaca plantations (Raymundo et al., 2001).  BBrMV was first isolated from bananas in the Philippines in 1979  (Magnaye and Espino, 1990; Thomas et al., 1997) but it was only reported in abaca in 2000 (Sharman et al. 2000).  Sequence analysis of the cloned BBrMV CP isolates showed that there is high sequence similarity to BBrMV database sequences belonging to the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. Percent identity matrix among the BBrMV CP sequences isolated from abaca showed sequence identity of 95.8-99.9% indicating low sequence variation among the BBrMV isolates infecting abaca (Galvez et al, 2019; Rodoni et al., 1999). Infected crops exhibit the characteristic mosaic symptom on the flower bracts, broad chlorotic leaf stripes, chlorotic spindle-shaped lesions and mosaic patterns on the leaves. Abaca plants affected by BBrMV also showed reduced plant height and stalk diameter thus resulting in poor fiber yield and quality (Lalusin and Villavicencio, 2015).          BBrMV can be transmitted through non-persistent manner by vectors such as Aphis gossypii Glover, Pentalonia nigronervosa Coq. and Rhophalosiphum maidis Fitch.  Moreover, BBrMV can be mechanically transmitted through vegetative planting material including corms, eyebuds,  and suckers.  In 2020, Selvarajan et al. reported that BBrMV is seed-transmitted.</string>
    <string name="bunchy_top_desc">Bunchy-top disease (BTD) is caused by viruses known as Abaca bunchy top virus (ABTV) and Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV).   The disease is widespread in abaca-growing areas and considered the most economically important in the Philippines (Raymundo, 2000; Raymundo et al., 2001).  ABTV and BBTV belong to the genus Babuvirus, family Nanoviridae (Sharman et al., 2008; Vetten et al., 2012).  Both viruses are transmitted by an aphid vector known as Pentanolia nigronervosa Coq. or the brown aphids through a persistent, non-propagative manner and through vegetative plant material (Dale, 1987; Kumar et al., 2015).  Infected plants exhibit ‘bunched top’ appearance, rosetting and stunting, narrowing and yellowing of the leaves, browning of leaf blades and appearance of Jhooks patterns in the leaf lamina (Galvez et. al. 2017) resulting to poor fiber quality and significant fiber yield loss (Ocfemia, 1930; Ocfemia and Buhay, 1934).    Both symptoms and manner of transmission of the causative viral agent of abaca BTD are very similar to those of banana BTD in banana (Ocfemia, 1931).  Although bunchy top in abaca was first reported in the Philippines in 1910 (Ocfemia, 1926), the first record of BBTD in banana in the Philippines was not until 1960 (Castillo and Martinez, 1961).  In 2017, both diseases were reported to be infecting abaca seeds and seed-derived abaca plants suggesting possible vertical transmission of bunchy top disease (Galvez, et al.,  2019; Barbosa, et al, 2021).   ABTV and BBTV can occur in single or mixed infections in abaca and without showing initial or early symptoms which makes disease control strategies very challenging.   Early detection of BTD is critical for selecting virus-free planting materials for mass production, for timely removal of diseased plants and replanting with healthy planting materials to rehabilitate diseased abaca plantations (Chandrasekar et al. 2011, Barbosa et al. 2020, Koh et al., 2020). For this purpose, modern methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) are employed, which include uniplex PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification LAMP (Sharman et al. 2008; Peng et al. 2012; Galvez et al. 2020). </string>
    <string name="CMV_desc">Placeholder</string>
    <string name="SCMV_desc">Mosaic virus in abaca is reported as a member strain of the sugarcane mosaic subgroup of the genus Potyvirus, designated SCMV-Ab (Gambley et al, 2004). In contrast to other members of the subgroup, it has a wider host range and naturally infects Musa textilis (Musaceae), Canna indica (Cannaceae), and Maranta arundinaceae  (Marantaceae) and experimentally infects various cultivars of banana (Musa sp.), cowpea (Vigna sinesis L.), corn (Zea mays L.), sugarcane  (Saccharum  officinarum L.), cogon (Imperata exaltata Brongn.), and other species in Poaceae (Kent, 1954; Thomas et al, 1997). The virus may be transmitted mechanically and through vegetative propagules, as well as by aphid    vectors A. gossypii, R. nympheae, and A. maidis, but interestingly not by the banana aphid P. nigronervosa, in a non-circulative, non-persistent manner.     Virus distribution is   reported to be limited thus far to the Philippines (Gambley, et al., 2004).   SCMV-Ab and BBrMV were confirmed to be serologically different. Symptoms of SCMV-Ab infected plant include various mosaic patterns, coloured midrib and streaks on petiole, and chlorotic lesions with rusty-red borders.  In sugarcane, SCMV was found to alter the structure and pigmentation in chloroplasts, causing depletion in photosynthetic activity, and hence, the display of chlorosis and mosaic symptoms which is similar to its manifestation in abaca.  Moreover, SCMV produces proteins that alter the size of the plasmodesmata during sucrose translocation, thus impairing the photo-assimilate trafficking.  Fibers derived from infected plants are shorter and weaker, and plants mature longer. The disease cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone, since sugar cane mosaic disease in abaca (SCMD-Ab) produce similar symptoms (e.g. chlorotic areas with rusty-red borders) as those produced by BBrMV and CMV infections in banana (Thomas and Magnaye, 1996).  Recently, high incidence of mixed   infections has made determination of the etiological agents and control of the disease difficult in different regions in the Philippines.
